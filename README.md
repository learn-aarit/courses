# courses
This repository documents my learning journey across various platforms such as Coursera, Udemy, YouTube, NPTEL, Telegram ,and more. Each folder includes notes, projects, resources, and takeaways from the course I completed or am currently learning. The goal is to maintain a transparent and organized record of how and what I learn over time.
